## The problem

India, with a population of 1.4 billion people, is currently the world's youngest country with approximately 65% of its population below the age of 35. However, this demographic advantage is accompanied by the problem of unemployment, particularly among the youth. Many youngsters are unaware of the various career paths and opportunities available beyond the conventional fields such as medicine, engineering, and civil services. As a result, they often struggle to find suitable employment that matches their interests, skills, and aspirations.

## The Solution

To address this issue, we present a solution **Upskill-Passion** comprehensive platform that offers a one-stop solution for the youth of India to explore various career paths and job opportunities. By registering on this platform, youngsters can access a plethora of resources such as informative blogs on different professions, a job search section to find relevant employment, and a Q&A page to seek guidance and advice regarding their career choices. This platform aims to empower the youth of India by providing them with the necessary knowledge and tools to make informed decisions about their professional lives, and help them secure rewarding and fulfilling careers.

## The platform and it's Features 
 
We assume two types of users on our platform one entity is Students and other one is Recruiter, based on their roles they have access to different resources. Some of the resources are common to both of them. Which are described below.

 1. User can see all the blogs about proffessions listed on the platform and perform search for a blog with the help of tags and minimum qualification required for the proffession.
 2. User can contribute to create a new blog about a proffession and list relevant resources to learn more about that particular proffession
 3. User can post a new question and see all the question posed by other users, he can search for questions and answer them, and comment on an answer.
 4. User can save a blog post or an answer to review later.

### Recruiter's specific features
Recruiters are entities who are not searching for a job, rather they want to post new jobs. Apart from this, recruiter can also be an **NGO offering courses/vocational training to students for free**.

1. Post a new job
2. See all the applicants and send emails to them

### Student's specific features
1.  Students can search for jobs on various filters, apply for a job, and save a job later.
2. Students can search for vocational courses offered by NGO's/Recruiters.

## UN SDG Goals we aim to target

Our solution contributes to United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal-4 and Goal-8.
### Goal 4 - Quality Education

>Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
#### [Target 4.4: Increase the number of people with relevant skills for financial success](https://sdg-tracker.org/quality-education#4.4) 

This goal specifically aims to substantially increase the number of youths, who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship. By providing Indian youth with access to information on various types of professions, jobs and career paths, and guiding them towards acquiring relevant skills, this solution can help increase the number of youth and adults with relevant skills, thus contributing to achievement of target 4.4.

### Goal-8 Decent Work and Economic Growth
>Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.

#### [Target 8.6: Promote youth employment, education and training](https://sdg-tracker.org/economic-growth#8.6)

This goal specifically aims to substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, by education or
training. By providing Indian youth with information and guidance on a range of career paths, this solution can help increase the proportion of youth in education or training and eventually in decent employment, thereby contributing to the achievement of target 8.6.

## Future of this project

Right now the project is in it's most basic state with very few features. We hope to implement following features in the future.



 1. We aim to build a mobile application so that it  can reach a wider audience.
 2. We aim to improve the UI/UX of the platform to make it more engaging and interactive for users.
 3. We aim to personalize guidance to our users by using AI and ML algorithms
 4. We plan to suggest simililar queries for searched queries by user
 
 We hope to develop this as a platform where anyone can seek guidance for their career, and ask question about their careers. A platform where students can learn about various proffessions and look fore resources which can help him, and if there is any NGO providing training or course for that. 
<!--We hope to achieve that by using donations from industry, if only we could build an infrastructure where NGO's can get fundings from industry, and help students to get their dream jobs. Companies can tell NGO's there requirements and NGO's can train students according to their needs, it seems very far fetched but anything can be achieved -->
